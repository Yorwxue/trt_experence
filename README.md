# TensorRT
+ Completed: TensorRt + Tensorflow
+ TODO: TensorRT + Onnx

## TensorRT with Tensorflow
+ Introduction and Code are placed in directory: "googlenet"
+ Because of library: "tensorflow.contrib.tensorrt" is deleted at tensorflow 2.0, the convert method may be different.
+ Note that TensorRT==5.1.5 may not support tensorflow 1.14, even thought it still has library: "tensorflow.contrib.tensorrt"
### Tensorflow >= 2.0
+ Seems not supported .. 2019/7/12

### Tensorflow <= 1.13
+ slim: change git branch to "slim_ver" for more detail

+ tensorflow model such as cnn can be found in branch: "tf1.13"

+ Method of both two are similar.
